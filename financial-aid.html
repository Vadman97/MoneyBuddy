          <h3 class="header">What is Financial Aid?</h3>
          <p>
            Financial Aid is funding available to students attending colleges. It comes under many categories.
          </p>

          <h3 class="header">Types of Financial Aid</h3>
          <h4 class="subheader">Gift Aid</h4>
          <p>
            Gift Aid is financial aid that does not need to be repaid, unlike loans. It can be broken down into
            two categories, scholarships, and grants. Scholarships are generally merit-based, although some can
            be need-based. Grants are generally need-based. Both can come from federal, state, or private sources.
            For USC specific scholarships, see our personalized section for recommended scholarships based on your unique situation.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader">Work Study</h4>
          <p>
            Work study are programs at schools to help earn money over the course of your education.
            For USC, you can find an on-campus job at <a href="https://careers.usc.edu/students/find-a-job/find-on-campus-jobs/">https://careers.usc.edu/students/find-a-job/find-on-campus-jobs/</a>.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader">Federal Student Loans</h4>
          <p>
            These loans are provided by the government. Federal student loans do not require you to start paying
            them until you graduate, leave school, or are under a half-time enrolled student. The interest rate
            on the loan is fixed and generally lower than private loans. Finally, some federal loans can be subsidized,
            where the government pays the interest on your loans.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader">Private Loans</h4>
          <p>
            These loans are provided by private entities, such as banks or credit unions. Many of these require you
            to pay while you are still in school, which can make it tough to pay for your education necessities and
            loans at the same time.

          <h3 class="header">FAFSA</h3>
          <p>
            This is the FAFSA for the 2019-2020 School Year: <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/2019-20-fafsa.pdf">https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/2019-20-fafsa.pdf</a>
            <br />
            <br />
            Here is a list of frequently asked questions:
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader">I don’t have a permanent mailing address because I don’t have a stable home. What address should I use?</h4>
          <p>
            Use an address where you will be able to receive mail reliably. This could
            be the address of a trusted mentor or family member. You may also use your
            school’s address as long as you have permission to do so, and a system has
            been set up for you to receive your mail.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader"> I was emancipated at age 15 but lived with my aunt and uncle during my last semester of high school. How should I complete the FAFSA? </h4>
          <p>
            Check “Yes” and complete the FAFSA as an independent student if you
            have a copy of a court order that you are an emancipated minor. The court
            must be located in your state of legal residence. If you do not have such a
            court order, you should check “No” for this question.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader">I have been living with a family member/friend who provides for some of my
            financial needs, but that person has not been appointed my legal guardian by
            a court. How should I complete the FAFSA?</h4>
          <p>
            A caregiver or other person with whom you are living is only considered a
            legal guardian if a court in your state of legal residence has established
            guardianship. You should check “Yes” if you have a copy of a court order
            indicating that legal guardianship was established. If you are living with a
            caregiver, but that caregiver is not your legal guardian as determined by a
            court in your state of legal residence, you should check “No” for this question.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader">I ran away from home during my senior year in high school and am staying temporarily with a friend. Am I considered an independent student?</h4>
          <p>
            You are considered an independent student if you received a determination any time on or after July 1, 2017, that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless, or an unaccompanied youth providing your own living expenses who is at risk of being homeless. The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to provide a copy of the determination.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader"> I stayed in a shelter last year. How do I complete the FAFSA?</h4>
          <p>
            Check “Yes” if you received a determination any time on or after July 1, 2015, that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless, or an unaccompanied youth providing your own living expenses who is at risk of being homeless. The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to provide a copy of the determination or other documentation.
          </p>
          <h4 class="subheader"> I am living in a transitional housing program. Am I an independent student?</h4>
          <p>
            Check “Yes” if you received a determination any time on or after July 1, 2017, that you were an unaccompanied youth who was homeless, or an unaccompanied youth providing your own living expenses who is at risk of being homeless. The financial aid administrator at your college may require you to provide a copy of the determination or other documentation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="subheader"> I never stayed in a shelter, but I stayed temporarily with others because I had nowhere else to go. I have already graduated from high school. Am I an independent student?</h4>
        <p>
          According to federal guidance,, if a student does not have, and cannot obtain, verification from a school district liaison or a HUD- or RHYA-funded shelter, a financial aid administrator must make a determination of eligibility. This means that the financial aid administrator is required to determine whether or not you meet the definition of “homeless” and “unaccompanied.” Contact the financial aid office to ask for this determination. Be prepared to provide some documentation of your status (a letter from an employer, counselor, clergy, people with whom you may be staying, or others). If you do not have any documentation, request an interview with the financial aid administrator. If you continue to face difficulties, please contact the NAEHCY Higher Education Helpline at 855.446.2673 for assistance.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subheader">  I provided a determination letter from my school liaison, but the financial aid
        office will not accept it. What should I do?</h4>
        <p>
          According to federal guidance, it is not considered “conflicting information” if a financial aid administrator disagrees with an eligibility determination by a school district homeless liaison or a shelter director. The financial aid administrator must accept this documentation, and then contact either the state homeless coordinator, or the appropriate federal agency, with any questions or concerns. If you continue to face difficulties, please contact the NAEHCY Higher Education Helpline at 855.446.2673 for assistance.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subheader"> I am homeless and unaccompanied, but I am 22 years old. Can I still
        receive a homeless status determination?</h4>
        <p>
          Yes. “Youth” means you are 21 years of age or younger or you are still enrolled in high school as of the day you sign this application. Answer “No” to Questions 56, 57, and 58 pertaining to status as a youth who is homeless and unaccompanied. Then contact your college financial aid office for assistance. Your college financial aid office can determine that you are “homeless” and “unaccompanied,” and therefore that you are not required to provide parental information.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subheader"> Do I need to list a foster parent, legal guardian or other adult’s income on
        my FAFSA?</h4>
        <p>
          If you are not under the care of your biological or adoptive parents and you are determined to be an unaccompanied homeless youth you should not report any information in the "parents" section. This includes any foster parents, former legal guardians, or any other adult you may be staying with at the time. Your FAFSA may reject by leaving this section blank, depending on how you answered questions about being an unaccompanied homeless youth, but do not panic. Instead, call your Financial Aid Office and they will help you clear your FAFSA and add your unaccompanied homeless youth determination.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subheader">
          I did not file a tax return, and I am not sure if I was required to file. How can
          I get information about whether I was required to file a tax return and how I can
          file now, if necessary?
        </h4>
        <p>
          You must consult the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules to determine your obligation to file a tax return. IRS information is available at <a href="http://www.irs.gov/">http://www.irs.gov/</a>. For the FAFSA, you should indicate whether you have filed or intend to file and continue to the following questions, as indicated.
